# Signals Capability

Every action taken by an attacker on one of our Honeypots is mapped to a unique entry called a signal.

These signals are then parsed and indexed into our data set for querying and analysis.

Our signal capability forms the foundation of all our other capabilities and intelligence, including:


* Queried using our [Search API](https://api.honeypotdb.com/docs) 
* Correlated into full events (On the roadmap :map:)
* Weighed via our MITRE ATT&CK driven Scoring System (On the roadmap :map:)
* Mapped into attack kill chains (On the roadmap :map:)
