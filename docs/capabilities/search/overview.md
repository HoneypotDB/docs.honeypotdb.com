Driven by our [Search API](https://api.honeypotdb.com), our entire dataset is available to query in's raw form.

Through this, you can search for actions taken to exploit specific CVEs, discover behaviors with MITRE ATT&CK TTPs and assess the efficacy of defenses.

Wherever possible, we aim to provide the raw logs we capture from our honeypots, making it easy to plan **SNAP** with data returned form our Search API and data in your own SIEM.
