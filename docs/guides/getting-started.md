Please complete the form, providing your name, type of account and a name for your account.


!!! note "Everyone gets a personal account"
    We're currently building our multi-tenant functionality, and as such everyone is currently assigned a unique Personal account, including members of organizations.
    
    In the future, your account may be converted to an organization account if required.

Please carefully read our service terms and conditions and confirm your acceptance with the checkbox before hitting 'Get Started' to proceed.

### Navigating the app
Once you've set up your account, you'll see the home page of the app. Over time this will fill out as we add more exciting capabilities and intelligence.

Navigating the application is pretty self-explanatory with our current capabilities on the left navigation pane and dark theme (of course), support button and logout button in the top right.

From the home page, you may access the profile section. Here you may edit your persona details, request a password reset and create API keys.
