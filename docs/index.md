## Who are we

At HoneypotDB. we're building a platform that tracks the real-world behaviors of cyber attackers to create activity-driven and example-led Threat Intelligence.

Powered by our global network of Honeypots disguised as CVE's, infrastructure and industries, we capture everything from network events, processed spaned, commands ran and filesystem events, all mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

We're converting this data into behavior-based intelligence, and generating full end-to-end attack kill chains to map out attacks and highlight how to detect and prevent them.

## About the platform

HoneypotDB is designed to be used as both an analysis and research tool via our powerful web application, and integrate natively into existing SIEAM, SOAR and CTI tooling.

### Web Application

Available at [https://app.honeypotdb.com](https://app.honeypotdb.com) our web application provides an interface to both Search our raw data via our Search API and discover metrics, trends and intelligence based on our data.

### API

Enable easy integration with existing security tooling, our RestAPI is live at [https://api.honeypotdb.com](https://api.honeypotdb.com) with the ability to execute a powerful Search of our data and query our intelligence APIs.
